    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <script>document.write(new Date().toLocaleDateString());</script></p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Lender Notebook</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Lender Notebook</strong> is designed to prioritize your privacy. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information or financial data on external servers.</p>
    <p>All data entered into the application (including borrower names, loan amounts, and dates) is stored locally on your device using an internal database (SQLite) and Shared Preferences. This data remains strictly under your control and is not accessible to the developers.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The application may request access to certain device features to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage/Files:</strong> Required to generate and save PDF receipts or reports to your device storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The application does not integrate with third-party analytics or advertising services that track user behavior.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend keeping your device software updated and using device-level security features (such as a passcode or biometric lock) to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Loss Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Please be aware that because your data is stored locally on your device, <strong>Lender Notebook</strong> cannot recover data in the event of loss. The following actions will result in permanent data loss:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deleting the App:</strong> Uninstalling the application will remove all stored data.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone Damage:</strong> Physical damage to your device may render the data unrecoverable.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearing App Data/Cache:</strong> Clearing the application's storage or cache memory in your device settings will erase your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
